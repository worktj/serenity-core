# Serenity BDD 2.1.4
This release includes enhancements to the Build Info section to allow better support for nested structures in the `serenity.conf` file.
You can now use human-readable labels and nested sections for properties that will appear in the Build Info page, as illustrated in this example:

```hocon
sysinfo {
  Lead Developer = Daisy
  build = "${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
  Test Run {
    Run By = "${env.USER}"
    Java Version = "${java.version}"
  }
}
```
