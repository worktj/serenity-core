# Serenity BDD 2.1.5
Serenity 2.1.5 release features a contribution from @a-en, the capability to process complex expressions in `@Step` annotations. When the parameter to a `@Step` method is an object, you can now refer to properties or methods of the object, for example: 

```
@Step("Open as user {0.email}")
public void open(User user){...}
```

or 

```
@Step("Open as user {0.getEmail()}")
public void open(User user)
```
